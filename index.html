            <h2>Ogun State, Nigeria</h2>
            <img src="image/ogun-state.jpg" alt="ogun state image" width="200">
            <p>Ogun state, Nigeria is a land blessed with many natural resources such as Lime stones, crude oil, rubber
                trees,
                to mention few, the capital city of the state is Abeokuta which means "under the rock" this name was
                given
                as a result of a giant rock that served as a hiden place for the ancient people during war. I'm always
                proud
                to
                tell people that i'm an indigen of Ogun state, Nigeria
